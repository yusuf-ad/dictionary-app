# Dictionary Web App

## Introduction

This is a solution to the [Dictionary Web Application](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/dictionary-web-app-h5wwnyuKFL) by [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io) built using React, TailwindCSS, and Context API. It is designed to provide users with fast, reliable dictionary lookups and supports features like dark mode for enhanced usability in different lighting conditions.

## Features

- **React:** Utilizes the power of React for building user interfaces with component-based architecture.
- **TailwindCSS:** Employs TailwindCSS for styling, leveraging its utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Context API:** Manages global state using React's Context API, making it easier to pass data throughout the application without prop drilling.
- **Dark Mode:** Implements dark mode using TailwindCSS, offering users a choice between light and dark themes for comfortable use regardless of the environment or preference.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures the application is fully responsive and accessible on various devices, providing a seamless experience on both mobile and desktop.

## What I Learned

During the development of this project, I gained valuable experience and learned several key concepts:

- **Tailwind CSS Variables:** Learned how to use CSS variables in TailwindCSS to customize and extend the framework to fit the design needs of the project. This included defining custom colors and font families.
- **State Management with Context API:** Enhanced my understanding of React's Context API for managing global state. This was crucial for implementing features that required shared state across multiple components, such as theme selection for dark mode.
- **Responsive Design Practices:** Improved my skills in creating responsive designs using TailwindCSS, ensuring the application looks and functions well on a wide range of devices.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Deepened my knowledge of React's component-based architecture, making the application more maintainable and scalable by encapsulating UI logic and styling within reusable components.
